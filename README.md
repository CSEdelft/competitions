# competitions


Every month, me (jonathan) will give *10 euros* __(note, this month you can win a tshirt)__ to the creator of the best submission that conforms to the monthly challenge.
me, together with Julius will judge.

Ideas for future challenges are welcome

# how to submit:

after you're done, make a gist (on github) and message me the link (discord: jonay2000#6848) or Julius (discord: J00LZ#9386). the link will be added to the file of the current competiton.

**Important** add compilation instructions to the gist so we can check the submission

multiple submissions are allowed

# this month:

## Linked Stack
Let's learn c! 

Implement, using the C programming language, a linked stack. this is a datastructure that performs the same operations as any stack but its implemented using a linked list. this means every `link` consists of a value (integer) and a pointer (next link). pushing to the stack should make a new link pointing to the previous last link, and popping from the stack should destroy the last created link and return it's (integer) value. (Watch out for memory leaks!) From all the submissions conforming to the following items:

* implemented using links
* links are structs
* pushing and popping operations are supported
* dynamically allocated with malloc and free
* no memory leaks

One will be (randomly) chosen to receive a custom TUdelft t-shirt.

*PLEASE POST PRIVATELY TO JONATHAN OR JULIUS*

note: to compile a c program (.c file) you can use gcc -o out <filename>.c just like you would with assembly
