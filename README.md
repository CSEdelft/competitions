# competitions


Every month, me (jonathan) will give *10 euros* to the creator of the best submission that conforms to the monthly challenge.
me, together with Julius will judge.

Ideas for future challenges are welcome

# how to submit:

after you're done, make a gist (on github) and message me the link (discord: jonay2000#6848) or Julius (discord: J00LZ#9386). the link will be added to the file of the current competiton.

**Important** add compilation instructions to the gist so we can check the submission

multiple submissions are allowed

# this month:

## Obfuscated fizzbuzz

create a program to genererate a sequence of numbers from 1 to 100. for every number divisible by 3 print fizz, for every number divisible by 5 print buzz, for every number divisible by both 3 and 5, print fizzbuzz. else just print the number. do this in the most obfuscated way possible.

Deadline: october the 10th, 2018
(yes this one is a bit shorter than a month, this one shouldnt be too difficult)

## Linked Stack
Lets learn c! 

Implement, using the C programming language, a linked stack. this is a datascructure that performs the same operations as any stack but its implemented using a linked list. this means every `link` consists of a value (integer) and a pointer (next link). pushing to the stack should make a new link pointing to the previous last link, and popping from the stack should destroy the last created link and return it's (integer) value. (Watch out for memory leaks!) From all the submissions conforming to the following items:

* implemented using links
* links are structs
* pushing and popping are supported
* dynamically allocated with malloc and free
* no memory leaks

one will be (randomly) chosen to receive a custom TUdelft tshirt with the following print:

note: to compile a c program (.c file) you can use gcc -o out <filename>.c just like you would with assembly

# previous challenges:

| challenge | winner | 
| --------- | ------ |

# possible future challenges:

* create some sort of pathfinding algorithm
* sorting algorithms (suggestions welcome)
* regex parser (probably too hard)
* creating a toy (turing complete) programming language of choice
* command line 'physics engine' that bounces a ball around
* commandline pong AI vs AI
* game jam with a twist (e.g. platformer with one input, shooter without shooting, etc)
* code golf (look it up)
* arithmetic expression parser in c

suggestions are welcome
